 Virtual lab for infrared spectroscopy

Infrared spectroscopy (IR spectroscopy or vibrational spectroscopy) is a technique used to study and identify chemical substances or functional groups in solid, liquid, or gaseous forms. It deals with the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum and can be analyzed in three ways: by measuring reflection, emission, and absorption. The major use of infrared spectroscopy is to determine the functional groups of molecules, relevant to both organic and inorganic chemistry.

We have developed an vitual lab for students to learn about IR spectroscopy. The lab includes the aim, principle, methodology and shows the characteristic graph for many compounds to help us identify the functional groups present in them.

We have also designed a quiz for students so they can check their progress.The quiz has 3 levels of difficulties(easy, medium and hard) and shows us our score at the end of the quiz.
